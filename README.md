## CockroachDB

[Pricing](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/) | [Plan a CockroachDB Serverless Cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/plan-your-cluster-serverless)

* All cluster activity, including SQL queries, bulk operations, and background jobs, is measured in Request Units, or RUs. An RU is an abstracted metric that represents the compute and I/O resources used by a database operation. In addition to queries that you run, background activity, such as automatic statistics to optimize your queries or connecting a changefeed to an external sink, also consumes RUs

## Xata

[Pricing](https://xata.io/pricing) | [Pricing (Docs)](https://xata.io/docs/concepts/pricing)

* The storage size represents the amount of data stored in the transactional database. Database storage in Xata encompasses not only disk space but also I/O rates and compute resources. The listed price per GB combines the costs of the three components allocated to each workspace
* Free plan: 15 parallel requests (6 primary + 9 from replicas) to the database
* Free tier: Limited to 75 requests/second (qps)
* Additional Features
  * Elasticsearch integration
  * File attachments (2GB, S3 and Cloudflare's CDN)
  * Image transformations (10k)
  * 250 AI-powered questions per workspace
  * Free plan users can request data restoration from a daily backup through our support team

* 1 database
* 60 hours compute time (per month)
* Databases for those on Hobby plans are configured with 0.25 logical CPUs
* Compute time is calculated based on the active time of your database, multiplied by the number of CPUs available
* If there are no incoming requests for a specified duration (default 300 seconds), the database scales down to zero, effectively pausing compute time billing
* Each Postgres database uses 33MB of storage space, even before any data is stored
